# ffrwd/moq

Media over QUIC in both directions, hosted in wasm. `publish` is a COPY
destination: the query's streams leave the graph for a relay broadcast,
encoded on the way out. `subscribe` is a FROM relation: a broadcast
arrives as rows, one per rendition, and the query does what it likes
with them.

## Publish

```pgsql
COPY (
  SELECT f.video[1]
  FROM input('film.mp4') f
) TO ffrwd.moq.publish('moqt://203.0.113.7:4443', 'live/demo')
```

The relation IS the broadcast: one row is one rendition, and a
rendition ladder is one row per rung:

```pgsql
COPY (
  SELECT scale(f.video[1], :widths[i.i], -2) AS v
  FROM input(:'source') f, generate_series(1, :rungs) i
) TO ffrwd.moq.publish(:'relay', :'broadcast')
  WITH (video_bitrate :'bitrates'[i.i], gop 30)
```

The compiler places the sink behind an encoder - shape it with the
COPY's `WITH` options, and a value read once per row shapes each
rung's encoder separately. The module packages each stream as
fragmented MP4: one `moof`+`mdat` fragment per each frame, a new MoQ group at every keyframe. Audio rides beside
the video as AAC, cut on frame edges about once a second.

A `catalog.json` track names what the broadcast carries, in the
[hang](https://github.com/kixelated/moq) catalog schema: renditions
keyed by name, each with its codec string, its geometry or sample
rate, and its init segment carried in the entry. A hang player picks a rendition and plays it; the
versions the claim was proven against are pinned in
`harness/hang-recv`.

The first publish is held until the track gains a subscriber: a MoQ
subscription starts at the latest group, so anything sent earlier
would never be seen. A run with nobody watching waits at the first
packet.

## Subscribe

`subscribe` reads that same hang catalog. The rows are the renditions,
carrying the rendition columns any manifest input has - `height`,
`width`, `bandwidth`, `codecs`, `name`:

```pgsql
COPY (
  SELECT s.video[1]
  FROM ffrwd.moq.subscribe(:'relay', :'broadcast') s
  WHERE s.height = 720
) TO 'rung.mp4'
```

The catalog is read at compile time, the way ffprobe reads a file, so
the broadcast must be on the relay before the query compiles.

What a broadcast carries decides the shape of a query over it. A
demuxed ladder puts a rung's video and the broadcast's audio on
different rows; a muxed broadcast carries both on one row.

## Relay

Both directions in one query is a relay, and whatever the query does
in between is a relay that transforms:

```pgsql
COPY (
  SELECT s.video[1], s.audio[1]
  FROM ffrwd.moq.subscribe(:'relay', :'from') s
  WHERE s.height = 1080
) TO ffrwd.moq.publish(:'relay', :'into')
```

## The relay's address

The relay's host is a name or an IP literal. The runner links no name
lookup, so a name is resolved over DNS-over-HTTPS against 1.1.1.1,
then 8.8.8.8 - both pinned by IP in the module - and every address
the answer carries is tried in turn.

A relay that demands authentication takes a `token`.

## License

This package is **MIT OR Apache-2.0**, and so is everything vendored
into it (`web-transport-quinn`, `quinn-udp`, `quinn-wasi` - each
carried for wasm32-wasip2 fixes upstream does not ship yet).

## Exports

- `publish(relay, broadcast, cert DEFAULT '', token DEFAULT '')`
  returns `sink`: a COPY destination, nothing comes back. It reads the
  whole relation - a video cell, an audio cell, either NULL - one
  rendition per row.
- `subscribe(relay, broadcast, cert DEFAULT '', token DEFAULT '')`
  returns `source`: a FROM relation, one row per rendition of the
  broadcast's catalog, a video cell and an audio cell, either NULL.
  Unbounded.

## Building

The module builds against the wit from the installed `ffrwd/wasm`
package, and ring's C sources want wasi-sdk's clang:

```
ffrwd install -g ffrwd/wasm
CC_wasm32_wasip2=<wasi-sdk>/bin/clang cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2 --release
```

The live pub/sub loops under `tests/` need moq-relay on the machine,
and wasmtime for the ones that drive a guest directly. They run only
when invoked directly.
